% This program partitions the elements in the extension of dom
% into two sets using the set difference operation.

% The following two rules build a cycle through external atoms.
% However, as output variable X is bounded by domain predicate dom,
% the program is strongly safe.
s1(X) :- dom(X), &setdiff[dom, s2](X).
s2(X) :- dom(X), &setdiff[dom, s1](X).
