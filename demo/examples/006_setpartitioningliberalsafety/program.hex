% This program partitions the elements in the extension of dom
% into two sets using the set difference operation.

% The following two rules build a cycle through external atoms
% which is not bounded by a domain predicate,
% thus they are not strongly safe.
% However, since all output elements of &setdiff must occur in the input,
% the program is liberally safe.
s1(X) :- &setdiff[dom, s2](X).
s2(X) :- &setdiff[dom, s1](X).
