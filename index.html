	<h2>The dlvhex Solver</h2>
	<p>
	  dlvhex is the name of a prototype application for
	  computing the models of so-called HEX-programs, which
	  are an extension of Answer-Set Programs towards
	  integration of external computation sources.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The source code of dlvhex is hosted at
	  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dlvhex/">SourceForge</a>.
	  If you are looking for the RDF- or
	  <a href="http://www.polleres.net/dlvhex-sparql">SPARQL-plugin</a>, please have a look at the

	<h3>A Brief History</h3>
	<p>
	  At the beginning of this project, we were pondering
	  about how to contribute to the current efforts of
	  shaping the Semantic Web.  People seem to have agreed on
	  the Ontology Layer with OWL as its prominent
	  specification language. The next step is to add rules in
	  order to have powerful and sophisticated inference
	  mechanisms on top of ontologies. This is were we saw the
	  opportunity of introducing Answer Set Programming (ASP)
	  to the Semantic Web development&mdash;believing in the
	  benefits of a fully declarative and nonmonotonic logic
	  programming semantics.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Our first goal was to extend ASP towards an interface to
	  Description Logics, which are the theoretical foundation
	  of ontology languages like OWL. We developed so
	  called <a href="http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/research/systems/semweblp/">dl-programs</a>,
	  which allow for a bidirectional flow of information
	  between an answer-set program and a DL knowledge base by
	  a novel type of atoms.
	</p>
	
	<h3>HEX-Programs</h3>
	<p>
	  Motivated by the need to interoperate with a broader set
	  of external computation sources and the observation,
	  that for meta-reasoning in the context of the Semantic
	  Web, no adequate support is available in ASP to date, we
	  extended the dl-program approach to HEX-programs, that
	  is, higher-order logic programs (which accommodate
	  meta-reasoning through higher-order atoms) with external
	  atoms for software interoperability.  Intuitively, a
	  higher-order atom allows to quantify values over
	  predicate names, and to freely exchange predicate
	  symbols with constant symbols, like in the rule
	</p>


	<pre>
C(X) :- subClassOf(D,C), D(X).</pre>

	<p>
	  An external atom facilitates to determine the truth
	  value of an atom through an external source of
	  computation. For instance, the rule
	</p>


	<pre>
reached(X) :- &amp;reach[edge,a](X)</pre>

	<p>
	  computes the predicate reached taking values from the
	  predicate &amp;reach, which computes via
	  &amp;reach[edge, a] all the reachable nodes in the graph
	  edge from node a, delegating this task to an external
	  computation source (e.g., an external deduction system,
	  an execution library, etc.).
